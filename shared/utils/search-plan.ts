export const searchPlanningRules = `Plan a search task, not a bag of keywords.
- Each query covers ONE angle. Choose concise domain keywords, an exact identifier or phrase, or a natural-language question according to the task. Preserve error messages, standards, paper titles, model numbers, and technical terminology; never force these into a conversational sentence or truncate by word count.
- Avoid unrelated keyword piles and source-type alternatives such as "official blog OR paper". Academic terms and Boolean alternatives can be meaningful in professional searches; use only syntax explicitly supported by the current provider. Never send database-specific field syntax to a general web engine.
- Separate filters into intent (general/news), timeRange (day/week/month/year) OR startDate/endDate (YYYY-MM-DD), and includeDomains (bare domains, only when explicitly requested or already verified in prior sources). Omit unused fields. Never invent a domain or a publisher whitelist.
- For recent/latest news without an explicit period, use timeRange=week. Honor explicit dates using today's date; do not invent a month from model memory. Filters describe publication windows; verify event dates separately in source text.
- Broad AI news requires complementary discovery queries covering models, products, and industry; do not silently narrow it to LLM papers. Example: query="AI product launches", intent="news", timeRange="week", sourcePreference="any".
- First discover events broadly. Once an entity/event is known, follow up with its name to find primary evidence, using intent=general and sourcePreference=primary. Source preference is an extraction preference, not a keyword or a hard domain filter.
- Follow-ups and rewrites must keep the requested time window and inherited domain restrictions. A weak result is not permission to broaden dates or domains. Stay within the query budget.`
