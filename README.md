# Deep Research Web UI

[English | [中文](README_zh.md)]

Deep Research Web UI turns a research question into a cited report: it plans searches, browses the web, verifies findings against real source pages, and lets you inspect and follow up on every citation — all from your browser, or self-hosted with your own API keys.

Features:

- 🚀 **Safe & Secure**: In Client Mode, config and API requests stay in your browser locally
- 🕙 **Realtime feedback**: Stream AI responses and reflect on the UI in real-time
- 🌳 **Search visualization**: Shows the research process using a tree structure. Supports searching in different languages
- 📄 **Export as PDF**: Export the final research report as Markdown / PDF
- 🤖 **Supports more models**: Uses plain prompts instead of newer, less widely supported features like Structured Outputs. This ensures to work with more providers that haven't caught up with the latest OpenAI capabilities.
- 🐳 **Docker support**: Deploy in your environment in one-line command
- 🔧 **Server Mode**: Deploy with environment variables, no need for users to configure API keys
- 🔎 **Evidence and follow-ups**: Inspect source excerpts from report citations, then research a finding further and update related passages while keeping the original report in history
- 🎯 **Focused search**: Separate queries from time and source filters, check result relevance, and retry once with a revised query when evidence is insufficient
- 📖 **On-demand full-page reading**: Fetches full source pages to extract verbatim evidence when search snippets aren't enough, sharing a token/request budget across the whole research run

Currently available providers:

- AI: OpenAI compatible, [ApiSmart](https://www.apismart.ai), SiliconFlow, InfiniAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Requesty, Ollama, LiteLLM and more
- Web Search: Tavily (1000 free credits / month), [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) (cloud / self-hosted), fastCRW (cloud / self-hosted), Google PSE

## How to use

### Inspect evidence and follow up

1. After a research finishes, click a `[1]`-style citation in the report, or click **Inspect evidence and follow up**.
2. In the evidence panel, review each finding's source, retrieval time, and excerpt. A new excerpt is only saved once it's matched against retrieved content; search summaries and page text are labeled separately. A matched excerpt does not by itself prove the finding — read it in context.
3. Enter what you want to verify, e.g. "Find the latest official pricing and confirm the eligibility terms," then click **Follow up and update report**. A follow-up searches at most two directions in one round, and updates only the Markdown blocks that cite that finding; tables and lists are updated as whole blocks.
4. On success, the new evidence and updated report are saved as a separate history entry, leaving the original report unchanged. On failure, cancellation, or when no matching excerpt is found, the original report is preserved.

This works in both Client Mode and Server Mode. Older history entries still load; findings without a saved excerpt are labeled accordingly. History is stored in your browser — export research you want to keep.

### Deployment modes

- **Client Mode**: users enter their own API keys in the browser. This is the best fit for static deployments such as EdgeOne Pages or `pnpm generate`.
- **Server Mode**: API keys are configured as server-side environment variables, so users do not need to enter keys in the UI. This requires an SSR/Nitro runtime such as the Docker image; it is not available in purely static deployments.

### Self hosted

#### Server Mode (Recommended)
Deploy with environment variables - users don't need to configure API keys. Use this mode when you can run the Nuxt server:

**Using Docker with environment variables:**

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_MODE=true \
  -e NUXT_AI_API_KEY=your-ai-api-key \
  -e NUXT_WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-search-api-key \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER=openai-compatible \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=tavily \
  anotia/deep-research-web:latest
```

**Using Docker with .env file:**

```bash
# Copy .env.example and update it with your configuration
cp .env.example .env
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env anotia/deep-research-web:latest
```

#### Client Mode (Traditional)
Users configure their own API keys in the browser. Use this mode for static deployments:

One-click deploy with [EdgeOne Pages](https://edgeone.ai/products/pages):

[![Deploy with EdgeOne Pages](https://cdnstatic.tencentcs.com/edgeone/pages/deploy.svg)](https://edgeone.ai/pages/new?from=github&template=https://github.com/AnotiaWang/deep-research-web-ui&from=github)

Use pre-built Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name deep-research-web -d anotia/deep-research-web:latest
```

Use self-built Docker image:

```
git clone https://github.com/AnotiaWang/deep-research-web-ui
cd deep-research-web-ui
docker build -t deep-research-web .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name deep-research-web -d deep-research-web
```

### Environment Variables

#### Server Mode Configuration
| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_MODE` | Enable server mode | `false` |
| `NUXT_AI_API_KEY` | AI provider API key | - |
| `NUXT_AI_API_BASE` | AI provider base URL | - |
| `NUXT_WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY` | Web search API key | - |
| `NUXT_WEB_SEARCH_API_BASE` | Web search base URL | - |
| `NUXT_PROXY_URL` | Outbound proxy URL (http/https/socks5/socks5h) | - |
| `NUXT_NO_PROXY` | Hosts bypassing the proxy | `localhost,127.0.0.1,::1` |

#### Public Configuration (Server Mode)
| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER` | AI provider type | `openai-compatible` |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_AI_MODEL` | AI model name | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_AI_CONTEXT_SIZE` | Context size | `128000` |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER` | Search provider | `tavily` |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_WEB_SEARCH_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` | Max concurrency | `2` |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_WEB_SEARCH_SEARCH_LANGUAGE` | Search language | `en` |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_TAVILY_ADVANCED_SEARCH` | Use Tavily advanced search | `false` |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_TAVILY_SEARCH_TOPIC` | Tavily search topic | `general` |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PSE_ID` | Google PSE ID | - |

#### Provider values

| Type | Supported values |
|------|------------------|
| AI provider | `openai-compatible`, `siliconflow`, `302-ai`, `infiniai`, `openrouter`, `requesty`, `deepseek`, `ollama`, `litellm` |
| Web search provider | `tavily`, `firecrawl`, `crw`, `google-pse`, `youcom` |

Notes:

- `NUXT_WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY` supports comma-separated keys for Tavily and Google PSE, for example `key1,key2,key3`.
- Google PSE requires both `NUXT_WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY` and `NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PSE_ID`.
- Firecrawl self-hosted deployments can set `NUXT_WEB_SEARCH_API_BASE`.
- fastCRW (`crw`) is a Firecrawl-compatible web scraper (single binary; self-host or cloud). It defaults to the cloud base `https://fastcrw.com/api` and reads the key from `NUXT_WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY` (document as `CRW_API_KEY`); self-hosted deployments can set `NUXT_WEB_SEARCH_API_BASE`.
- You.com (`youcom`) reads its key from `NUXT_WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY` (optional, comma-separated keys supported for rotation). Without a key it uses the keyless endpoint with a limited daily quota; get a key at https://you.com/platform/api-keys.
- Ollama uses `http://localhost:11434/v1` as the default API base. When running the app inside Docker, `localhost` refers to the container itself, so set `NUXT_AI_API_BASE` to a reachable host or Docker network address if Ollama runs outside the container.
- LiteLLM uses `http://localhost:4000/v1` as the default API base. Its API key is optional when the proxy does not require authentication; set `NUXT_AI_API_BASE` when the proxy is not reachable at the default local address.
- Requesty uses `https://router.requesty.ai/v1` as the default API base and expects model IDs in `provider/model` format, such as `openai/gpt-4o`.

#### Outbound proxy (Server Mode only)

Set `NUXT_PROXY_URL` to route server-side requests through a proxy:

```bash
NUXT_PROXY_URL=socks5h://user:pass@gate.example.com:7777
NUXT_NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1
```

- Supported schemes: `http`, `https`, `socks5`, `socks5h`, `socks`.
- `http(s)` proxies cover everything: AI providers, Google PSE, you.com, and the Tavily / Firecrawl / CRW SDKs.
- `socks*` proxies cover AI providers, Google PSE and you.com; the Tavily / Firecrawl / CRW SDKs (axios-based) cannot speak SOCKS and will connect directly — use the `http://` endpoint of the same proxy (same credentials on most providers) for full coverage.
- `NUXT_NO_PROXY` accepts `*`, exact hosts and parent domains (`example.com` also matches `api.example.com`). Local AI gateways (Ollama, LiteLLM) and self-hosted scrapers stay direct via the default list.
- Standard `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` env vars are honored as fallback when `NUXT_PROXY_URL` is unset.
- Proxy credentials are redacted in logs.
- Client Mode (browser) cannot use this: browsers have no SOCKS API. Configure a system / browser proxy instead.
- URL-encode special characters in credentials (`%` as `%25`, `@` as `%40`, `:` as `%3A`).
- An invalid `NUXT_PROXY_URL` fails server startup (fail-fast) instead of silently going direct.
